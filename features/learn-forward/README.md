# Forward `/learn` URLs

This adjustment forwards all URLs starting with `/learn/...` to the official overleaf docs.

As this documentation is not part of community-releases of Overleaf, self-hosted instances usually throw a `404` error.
With this change in configuration, the Overleaf-internal `nginx` responds with a `308 Permanent Redirect` to `https://www.overleaf.com/learn/...`,
which often performs one more redirect to point to the actual documentation.
